Project Scenario
You’ve just joined the Business Intelligence team at Rapid Scale, a fast-growing SaaS company offering tiered subscription plans. Every month, your team supports the Monthly Business Review (MBR) meeting by analysing user behaviour data.
Your manager has shared a recent customer sign-up dataset and asked you to complete a data quality audit and provide insights into user acquisition trends. This report will help the Marketing and Onboarding teams optimise their campaigns and engagement workflows.
They’re particularly interested in:
•
Identifying where the data may be inaccurate or incomplete
•
Understanding how users are signing up and which plans they’re choosing
•
Assessing marketing opt-in behaviour and demographics
